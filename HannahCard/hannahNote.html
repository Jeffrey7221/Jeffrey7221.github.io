            <h1>Dear Hannah (aka Sarah)</h1>
    <p> HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY!!! I hope that you had a great birthday, and that your next year will be amazing :)
    </p>
    <p> I'm really glad I got to meet you this year, sorry that I forgot your name so many times LOL. It's been great
        getting to know you better and growing our friendship. You're a very cheerful and caring person, and you always make
        me smile. Thanks for being such a good friend to me, and for giving me advice when I needed it last quarter ;)
    </p>
    <p> I hope that we will become better friends over the next couple years, and that I will be able to be a good
        brother in Christ to you. I will support all your future Koreaboo endeavors full heartedly, whether it's about K-dramas,
        K-pop, Lee Jong Suk, or who knows what else. (I can't wait for the BTS concert this summer, HYPEEEE.)
    </p>
    <p> Your fave freshie,
    </p><p> Jeffy :)
